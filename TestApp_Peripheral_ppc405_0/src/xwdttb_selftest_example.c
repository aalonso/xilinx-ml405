* This function does a minimal test on the watchdog timer timebase device and
* driver as a design example.  The purpose of this function is to illustrate
* how to use the XWdtTb component.
*
* This function assumes that the reset output of the watchdog timer
* timebase device is not connected to the reset of the processor. The function
* allows the watchdog timer to timeout such that a reset will occur if it is
* connected.  It the interrupt output is connected to an interrupt input, the
* user must handle the interrupts appropriately.
*
* This function may require some time (seconds or even minutes) to execute
* because it waits for the watchdog timer to expire.
*
*
* @param	DeviceId is the XPAR_<WDTB_instance>_DEVICE_ID value from
